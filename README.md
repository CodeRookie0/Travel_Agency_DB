## Content Overview
The database contains information about customers, including personal data, contacts and addresses, which facilitates identification and communication. Additionally, data on continents, countries and cities enable you to choose the right travel destination.

Information about hotels, flights, guides, drivers and buses is crucial to putting together comprehensive travel packages. They allow you to choose the best accommodation options, flight routes and transport between destinations.

Travel bookings are tracked in a separate table, making it easy to manage them and monitor your customers' travel history. This allows the agency to tailor its offer to customer preferences, ensuring high quality of services and customer satisfaction, which in turn translates into an increase in income.


## Additional info:<br>
This project is not commercial. The main goal of "Travel Agency Database" is to learn
- Developing, implementing and programming a server-side database in an environment
MS SQL Server
- Development of design documentation

## Planned changes:
This project is **at the development stage** and has not been completed. I am planning to 
- ~~Add an archive table~~
- Add system users divided into users, administrator, office employee, etc., assigning appropriate permissions
- Expanding tbl_hotel table to include hotel availability, different room types.
- ~~Expanding tbl_package table to include places available for reservation~~
- Add additional attractions in the city travel
- ~~Add additional procedures and functions for greater database functionality (automatically "deleting" (archiving) outdated records )~~
- Create a dekstop application after searching for travel using the presented database
